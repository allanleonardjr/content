# Using the Graphcool CLI for a multi-stage development workflow

## Overview

In most real-world projects, developers maintain (at least) two different environments:

- **Development (_dev_)**: Used during the development phase
- **Production (_prod_)**: Used when the app gets deployed, this is where real user data is stored and managed

In this tutorial, we want to show a typical workflow for how these two different environments can be properly maintained using the [Graphcool CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphcool).

## Getting Started

Let's assume we're starting from scratch with a brandnew Instagram application that has the following simple schema:

```graphql
type Post {
  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
}
```

The workflow we are going to simulate in this tutorial looks as follows:

1. Create new Graphcool project that is used in dev
2. Prepare a clone of the dev project for prod
3. Iterate on the application by adjusting the schema of the dev project
4. Move all changes that happened in dev to prod

## 1. Creating development project

Let's go ahead and create the development environment with `graphcool init`:

```bash
graphcool init --schema https://graphqlbin.com/instagram.graphql --name InstagramDev --alias insta-dev --output dev.graphcool
```

This will create a new project called `InstagramDev` in our Graphcool account. In future commands, we can further refer to the project by using the _alias_ `insta-dev` instead of using the project ID. The schema is fetched from the remote URL `https://graphqlbin.com/instagram.grapqhl` and the project file will be written to `dev.graphcool`.

This is what the project `dev.graphcool` file look like:

```graphql
# project: insta-dev
# version: 1

type File implements Node {
  contentType: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String!
  secret: String! @isUnique
  size: Int!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  url: String! @isUnique
}

type Post implements Node {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  description: String!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  imageUrl: String!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User implements Node {
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

This is the project that we'll use for our development environment. It will never actually store any data from our end users.

## 2. Cloning for production

Fast forward a bit and assume we're now done with all the frontend work and ready to deploy version 1.0 of the app. Before we do so, we need to create the _production environment_ with a schema that's identical to the one from dev. This can be done by calling the `init` command again and passing in the `--copy` and `--copy-options` arguments:

```bash
graphcool init --copy insta-dev --name Instagram --alias insta-prod --copy-options mutation-callbacks --output prod.graphcool
```

The only difference now is in the first line of the two project files:

```graphql
# project: insta-prod
```

Depending on the client technology that was used, we now only have to adjust the API endpoints in the code that we wrote in the actual application and are ready to deploy ðŸš€


## 3. Another product iteration

After version 1.0 of our app was deployed, we collected some feedback and did another iteration on the app and the schema. In particular, there are three changes that we added incrementally to the schema:


**1)** Updating the `Post` type by renaming the `description` field to `title`, adding an optional field `subTitle` and a required field `location`

  ```graphql
  type Post implements Node {
    ...
    title: String! @rename(oldName: "description")
    subTitle: String
    location: String! @migrationValue(value: "Unknown")
  }
  ```

  Note that we're using the `@rename` and `@migrationValue` [directives](!alias-aeph6oyeez). The latter is necessary because we already have posts in the database. Since we're now adding a new required field to the `Post` type, these existing posts need a value that can be written into these fields, that's precisely what we specify with the `@migrationValue` directive.

  We can submit the changes with `graphcool push dev.graphcool`.

**2)** Create a relation between `Post` and `User` so that it's clear which user created a post. We thus update the `Post` and the `User` type by adding a new _one-to-many_-relation:

  ```graphql
  type Post implements Node {
    ...
    postedBy: User @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  }

  type User implements Node {
    ...
    posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  }
  ```

  The changes were again submitted by using `graphcool push dev.graphcool`.

**3)** Add a new type `Comment` including a _many-to-many_-relation to `Post` and a _one-to-many_-relation to `User` so that users can comment on Posts.

  ```graphql
  type Comment implements Node {
    author: User @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
    post: Post @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  }

  type Post implements Node {
    ...
    comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  }

  type User implements Node {
    ...
    comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
  }
  ```

  Again, `graphcool push dev.graphcool` was used to make these changes take effect.

After we've performed these migrations, our project file has now grown to look as follows:

```graphql
# project: insta-dev
# version: 4

type Comment implements Node {
  author: User @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  post: Post @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type File implements Node {
  contentType: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String!
  secret: String! @isUnique
  size: Int!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  url: String! @isUnique
}

type Post implements Node {
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  imageUrl: String!
  location: String!
  postedBy: User @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  subTitle: String
  title: String!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User implements Node {
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

Note that `@rename` and `@migrationValue` were only _temporary_ directives that were used for one particular schema migration, so they've been removed by the server after that migration was performed.

## 4. Update production environment

To make sure our changes are transferred to the production environment, we have to update the schema in `prod.graphcool` manually and then perform the migration in the same way we did before. The schema needs to be identical to the one we currently have in `dev.graphcool`, plus any directives that we used for schema migrations along the way.

The manual process can also be replaced by a script where the schema from `dev.graphcool` is written automatically into `prod.graphcool`. Assuming we either used such a script or pasted the schema over manually, our `prod.graphcool` file should now look similar to `dev.graphcool` - except for the frontmatter and the migration directives:

```graphql
# project: insta-prod
# version: 1

type Comment implements Node {
  author: User @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  post: Post @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type File implements Node {
  contentType: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String!
  secret: String! @isUnique
  size: Int!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  url: String! @isUnique
}

type Post implements Node {
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsOnPost")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  imageUrl: String!
  location: String! @migrationValue(value: "Unknown")
  postedBy: User @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  subTitle: String
  title: String! @rename(oldName: "description")
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

type User implements Node {
  comments: [Comment!]! @relation(name: "CommentsByUser")
  createdAt: DateTime!
  id: ID! @isUnique
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "PostsByUser")
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

We can apply the changes by calling `graphcool push prod.graphcool` and are ready to deploy our next product iteration. ðŸ˜Ž
